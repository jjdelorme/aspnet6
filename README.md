# Minimal .NET 6 Web API

Uses a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) approach to load the .NET 6 nightly SDK in a container for inner loop of development.

This is based on the [.NET 6 Preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-4/) blog post.
